# Food For Thought
Food waste has become a major issue in the global commercial food sector, businesses are discarding sizable amounts of unsold but consumable food at the end of every working day.
This project aims to provide a platform that enables businesses to reduce their food waste and the associated costs around its disposal. An application has been developed allowing businesses to advertise their surplus food at a nominal price or free of charge. Members of the general public can view advertisements by businesses in their locality and contact them about accessing the advertised food. Through the regular use of this application businesses and members of the public can work symbiotically to reduce food waste and its negative impact on the environment. Methods of gamification are deployed in the application to increase user engagement. The successful adoption of this application serves as a direct method of combating the issue of commercial food waste and reducing the amount of greenhouse gases being produced by the commercial food sector.
